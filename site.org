I am scientific software developer living in beautiful [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado][Boulder, Colorado USA]]. I am passionate about the application of computing technology to science and math. I am currently employed at the [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata Program Center]] and have been part of the [[http://www.ucar.edu][UCAR organization]] [fn:1] since 1999 when I started here as a [[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/staffnotes/9907/newhires.html][student]]. I specialize in scientific data, metadata, analysis and visualization using a variety of programming languages and technologies.

[fn:1] The [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata Program Center]] (UPC) is part of the [[https://www.ucp.ucar.edu/][UCAR Community Programs]] (UCP), which is part of the [[http://www.ucar.edu][University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (UCAR). The most well-known organization within UCAR is the [[http://ncar.ucar.edu][National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR) partially located at the iconic [[https://www2.ucar.edu/campus/mesa-laboratory][Mesa Lab]] in Boulder.

** Extending Emacs rgrep for Org Mode Only Search
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: rgrep
:EXPORT_DATE: <2019-05-23 Thu>
:END:

I recently wanted to extend emacs ~rgrep~ to search within org files only. Here is what I came up with:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun jc/rgrep-org (regexp dir)
    "rgrep for org files only"
    (interactive
     (progn
       (grep-compute-defaults)
       (let* ((regexp (grep-read-regexp))
              (dir (read-directory-name "Base directory: "
                                        nil default-directory t)))
         (list regexp dir))))
    (rgrep regexp "*.org" dir nil))
#+END_SRC


Note that in order to get this ~jc/rgrep-org~ function to work, I had to study and borrow from the internals of ~rgrep~. In particular, the ~interactive~ form was most inspired  from studying ~grep.el.gz~.
\\
 ~M-x find-function rgrep~ for more details.

** Installing X11 Emacs with homebrew
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: x11
:EXPORT_DATE: <2019-05-01 Wed>
:END:

A while back it was decided that [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/3531#issuecomment-251857552][X11 support would be removed from homebrew-core]]. Taking matters into my own hands and in the spirit of OSS, I now [[https://github.com/julienchastang/homebrew-core/tree/x11emacs][maintain my own version for anyone who wants it]]. On MacOS, you will find homebrew-core in =/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core=.

Once you have the fork ~brew reinstall emacs --with-x11~.

I only occasionally maintain that branch so if you want something more up-to-date, be sure to rebase against ~homebrew-core/master~.

Enjoy!
