[[file:static/me.png]]

I am scientific software developer living in beautiful [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado][Boulder, Colorado USA]]. I am passionate about the application of computing technology to science and math. I am currently employed at the [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata Program Center]] and have been part of the [[http://www.ucar.edu][UCAR organization]] [fn:1] since 1999 when I started here as a [[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/staffnotes/9907/newhires.html][student]]. I specialize in scientific data, metadata, analysis and visualization using a variety of programming languages and technologies.

[fn:1] The [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata Program Center]] (UPC) is part of the [[https://www.ucp.ucar.edu/][UCAR Community Programs]] (UCP), which is part of the [[http://www.ucar.edu][University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (UCAR). The most well-known organization within UCAR is the [[http://ncar.ucar.edu][National Center for Atmospheric Research]] (NCAR) partially located at the iconic [[https://www2.ucar.edu/campus/mesa-laboratory][Mesa Lab]] in Boulder.
